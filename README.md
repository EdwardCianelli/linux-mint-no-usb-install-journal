A technical journal of how I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon on my laptop without a USB drive — using Grub2Win, Puppy Linux, and extracted ISOs.
# Installing Linux Mint Cinnamon Without a USB Drive

This repository documents my successful attempt to install Linux Mint Cinnamon on a dual-drive laptop **without using a USB stick**. The process required manual GRUB2 configuration, ISO extraction, loopback handling, and kernel panic debugging.

This journal shows my hands-on knowledge of Linux boot systems — a key part of my journey toward becoming a security analyst.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Grub2Win
- Puppy Linux (Fossapup64 9.5)
- Extracted Mint ISO (22.1 Cinnamon)
- Terminal tools: `dd`, `lsblk`, `mount`, `gparted`, `grub console`

## 🧩 Key Challenges

- No USB available
- Kernel panics during boot
- Filesystem squashfs not found
- Mounting and formatting drives across Windows and Linux

## 📁 Key Files

- [`installation-steps.md`](installation-steps.md) – all the steps I took
- [`grub2win-config.md`](grub2win-config.md) – my working GRUB entries
- [`errors-and-fixes.md`](errors-and-fixes.md) – what went wrong and how I fixed it
- [`lessons-for-security-analysts.md`](lessons-for-security-analysts.md) – what I learned that applies to real-world security

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

Include photos of kernel panics, GRUB errors, `dd` burn process, etc.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Installing Linux without a USB required deep knowledge of:
- Bootloaders (GRUB2)
- Kernel/initrd handling
- Filesystems (ext4, vfat, squashfs)
- Manual troubleshooting

This is the kind of low-level skill that’s directly applicable to real-world cybersecurity work — especially in forensics, threat hunting, and malware reverse engineering.
