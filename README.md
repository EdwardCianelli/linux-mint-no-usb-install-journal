# Installing Linux Mint Cinnamon Without a USB Drive

This repository documents my successful attempt to install **Linux Mint Cinnamon 22.1** on my dual-drive laptop **without using a USB stick**. I completed this using **Grub2Win**, **Puppy Linux (Fossapup64 9.5)**, and a series of manually crafted GRUB2 configurations.

The process required resilience, deep Linux bootloader knowledge, filesystem understanding, and direct command-line work ‚Äî all relevant to real-world cybersecurity work.

## üß† Why This Matters

Installing Linux without a USB required deep knowledge of:
- Bootloaders (GRUB2)
- Kernel/initrd handling
- Filesystems (ext4, vfat, squashfs)
- Manual troubleshooting

This is the kind of low-level skill that‚Äôs directly applicable to real-world cybersecurity work ‚Äî especially in forensics, threat hunting, and malware reverse engineering.
