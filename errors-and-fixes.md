# ðŸ§¯ Errors and Fixes

## Kernel Panic
- âœ… Fixed by switching from loopback ISO boot to extracted kernel/initrd files

## VFAT/VFS Errors
- Caused by booting ISO from FAT32 â€” fixed by loading Puppy to RAM

## Missing `filesystem.squashfs`
- Mint failed to find root filesystem when ISO was unpacked â€” fixed by avoiding `findiso=` and using full ISO instead

## GRUB Device Mismatch
- `(hd1,2)` sometimes became `(hd0,2)` depending on boot order â€” used `search --file` to dynamically find correct device
