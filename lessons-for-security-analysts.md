# 🔐 Lessons for Security Analysts

## 🧠 Practical Takeaways

### 1. Linux Bootloaders
- Learned how `grub2` loads `vmlinuz` + `initrd`
- Manually edited GRUB entries, no GUI tools

### 2. Partitioning and Filesystems
- Converted NTFS to ext4 manually using `gparted`
- Managed mounted and unmounted partitions across OSes

### 3. Live OS & ISO Management
- Used `dd` to write raw ISOs without errors
- Understood differences between loopback ISO and extracted boot

### 4. Persistence and Debugging
- Dealt with boot loops, kernel panics, broken GRUB entries
- Solved real problems that required adapting boot commands

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Security Roles
- Understanding how systems boot = understanding **persistence** and **malware footholds**
- Comfort with bootloaders, filesystems, and mounting = essential for **incident response**
- Shows initiative, grit, and real-world experience — not just certificate knowledge
